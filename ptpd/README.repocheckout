If you are getting this code from a tarball distribution, this
file does not apply to you.

If you are getting this code from a repo checkout, you will need to
have autoconf, automake, and libtool installed.

Run:

 % autoreconf -vi

to generate the build environment. On some older systems you may get
libtool errors (./libtool: line nnnn: X[command]: command not found) -
in that case use:

 % libtoolize --force --copy; aclocal; autoconf; automake
